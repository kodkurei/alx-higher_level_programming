0. Print a list of integers

A function that prints all integers of a list, one per line.
Without importing modules or casting integers into strings.
1. Secure access to an element in a list

A function that retrieves an element from a list.
If idx is negative or out of range the function returns None.
Without import modules or using try/except.
2. Replace element

A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.
If idx is negative or out of range the function returns the original list.
Without importing modules or using try/except.
3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!

A function that prints all integers of a list, one per line, in reverse order.
Without importing modules or casting integers into strings.
4. Replace in a copy

A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
If idx is negative or out of range the function returns the original list.
Without importing modules or using try/except.
5. Can you C me now?

A function that removes all characters c and C from a string and returns the string.
Without importing modules or using str.replace().
6. Lists of lists = Matrix

A function that prints a matrix of integers, one row per line.
Without casting integers into strings.
7. Tuples addition

A function that adds two tuples.
Returns a tuple with two integers:
The first element is the addition of the first element of each argument.
The second element is the addition of the second element of each argument.
If a tuple is smaller than 2, the value 0 is used for the missing integer.
If a tuple is larger than 2, only the first two integers are used.
Without importing modules.
8. More retu
A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
If the string is empty, the first character should equal None.
Without importing modules.
9. Find the max

A function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
If the list is empty, the function returns None.
Without importing modules or using the builtin max().
10. Only by 2

A function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list. * Returns a new list of the same size. Each element of the new list contains either True or False corresponding to whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2.
Without importing modules.

11. Delete at

A function that deletes an item at a specific position in a list.
12. Switch

A program that switches the values of variable a and b.
Completion of this source code.
13. Linked list palindrome

C function that checks if a singly-linked list is a palindrome.
If the function is not a palindrome - returns 0.
If the function is a palindrome - returns 1.
An empty list is considered a palindrome.
14. CPython #0: Python lists
