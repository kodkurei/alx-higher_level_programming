The initial matrix is not modified.
Without importing modules.
1. Search and replace

Python function that replaces all occurences of an element by another in a new list.
The parameter my_list is the initial list.
The parameter search is the element to replace in the list.
The parameter replace is the new element.

Dictionary values can have any type.
Without importing modules.
7. Update dictionary

Python function that replaces or adds key/value pairs in a dictionary.
The parameter key is always a string.
The parameter value is any type.
If a key exists in the dictionary, the value is replaced.
If a key does not exist in the dictionary, it is created.
Without importing modules.
8. Simple delete by key

Python function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
The paramter key is always a string.
If the key does not exist, the dictionary does not change.
Without importing modules.
9. Multiply by 2

Python function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
The function assumes all values are integers.
Without importing modules.
10. Best score

Python function that returns a key value with the biggest integer value.
The function assumes all values are integers.
The function assumes all students have a different score.
If no score is found, the functino returns None.
Without importing modules.
11. Multiply by using map

Python function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number using map.
Returns a new length of the same length has my_list with each value multiplied by number.
The initial list is not modified.
Without using loops or importing modules.
12. Roman to Integer

Python function that converts a roman numeral to an integer.
The function assumes the number will be between 1-3999.
If the parameter roman_string is not a string or None, the function returns 0.
13. Weighted average!

Python function that returns the weighted average of all integers in a list of tuples.
Tuple format: (<score>, <weight>).
If the list is empty - returns 0.
Without importing modules.
14. Squared by using map
